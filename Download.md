Egoshots consists of real-life ego-vision images captioned using state of the art image captioning models, and aims at 
evaluating the robustness, diversity, and sensitivity of these models, as well as providing a real life-logging setting on-
the-wild dataset that can aid the task of evaluating real settings. It consists of images from two computer scientists while 
interning at Philips Research, Netherlands, for one 1 month each. 

Images are taken automatically by the Autoographer wearable camera when events of interest are detected autonomously.

Egoshots Dataset images are availaible at [Egoshots](https://github.com/NataliaDiaz/Egoshots) repo with corresponding 
(transfer learning pre-trained) captions [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fHt1GLRsIUNdwvovSINU_CqLMRT6ZTl4).
